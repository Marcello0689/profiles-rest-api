# profiles REST API

profile rest api course code.


When we do a project that involves git it's a good thing to start an ignore file that tells git what
to ignore. This is just a list of files.

Moreover, another useful stuff to do before puttng code on github is a license file.

Through a licence file you state what others can do with snippets of your code and you protect yourself against
possible rivendtications rising from effects of your code when it gets used by others.
